# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Unpleasant disease sucks, see @fig-awesome-plot.

We can have supplementary figures/tables too, with their own numbering and everything, see @suppfig-1 & @supptbl-example.

```{r}
#| label: fig-awesome-plot
#| fig-cap: A cool figure showing important stuff
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```

We can cite other stuff too, [Quarto](www.quarto.org) is pretty neat![@AllaireQuarto2022]

We can even embed stuff plots and tables from other notebooks, @fig-example!
Notice how we get a handy link to the source notebook for the chunk too!

{{< embed 04_data_analysis/001_first_experiment_analysis/01_first-script.qmd#fig-example >}}

And here's a table, @tbl-example2

{{< embed 04_data_analysis/001_first_experiment_analysis/01_first-script.qmd#tbl-example2 >}}

# Results {#sec-results}

I already put them in the introduction, what do you want from me?!
I can reference that section though @sec-intro, so that's neat

## Some particular aspect of the results

We can have subsections too, isn't this fun

# Discussion {#sec-disc}

And R is pretty neat too![@base]

# Supplementary materials

![A placeholder image](https://placehold.co/600x400.png){#suppfig-1 key="suppfig"}

And here a supplementary table

::: {#supptbl-example}
```{r}
gt::gt(head(mtcars))
```

And here's a table caption.
:::

::: {#supptbl-packages}
```{r}
# Get session information
session_info <- sessioninfo::session_info()

# Extract package information
package_info <- session_info$packages %>%
  dplyr::select(package, loadedversion, source) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(package)

# Convert to a data frame
package_df <- as.data.frame(package_info)
# Print table
package_df |>
  dplyr::group_by(source) |>
  gt::gt()
```

A table with the packages used and their versions
