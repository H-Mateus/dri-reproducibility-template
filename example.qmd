## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

If you like to organise you code into several discrete scripts for better organisation, but equally would like a single place that marries all your code together, there's a couple of relatively solutions Quarto offers.

You can use [includes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) to inset other quarto scripts into a master file like so:

```
{{< include scripts/01_first-script.qmd >}}
```

Which results in the following:

{{< include scripts/01_first-script.qmd >}}

And here is the second script included:

{{< include scripts/02_second-script.qmd >}}
