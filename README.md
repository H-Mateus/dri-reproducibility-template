# A template for reproducible research projects

Welcome!

The aim of this repo is to be eventually evolve into a (somewhat opinionated) standardised project template for incorporating best practices in reproducibility.

The hope is to reduce the friction of adopting good practices and thereby increase adoption, or failing that at least formalise my own way of working :P

Any ideas, thoughts or other contributions are very welcome!
I'm organising my own thoughts on [issues](https://github.com/H-Mateus/dri-reproducibility-template/issues) page, so check there if you're interested

## A rough roadmap

- Establish a sensible directory structure with documentation for file naming conventions
- Figure out all the continuous integrations to include (and how to make them work :sweat_smile:)
- Document the timeline of a project (planning > registered report > apply for funding > preprint > peer-reviewed publication (in a [diamond open-access journal](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/open-access/diamond-open-access/) if I have anything to say about it!))
- Find someone to actually use the template with a real project (ideally not a bioinformatician!)
- Have project go perfectly to publication > use as showcase
- ???
- Profit :stuck_out_tongue:
