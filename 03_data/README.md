## Directory purpose

This folder is to contain raw experimental data, with sub-folders for each experiment, or links to other repositories that house raw data.
It also contains a directory for any processed data that mirrors the numerical index of the relevant experiment.

"Raw data" here refers to data that has not been edited in *any* way from creation.
This will typically be the output of an instrument of some kind.

The processed data is any raw data that has been modified in some way.
This will often be data after QC steps have been applied.
It could be an intermediate data that is to be further processed/analysed, or it could be models or figures to present in publications.

## *TODO* 
- explore [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) as possibility for syncing larger files in arbitrary locations during project
  - The tonic-team potentially have a solution for this already that could be explored: [https://github.com/tonic-team/synchronisation_scripts](https://github.com/tonic-team/synchronisation_scripts)
