# Apply QC

Here is some prose.
Maybe you'd do some QC here.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example-cars
#| tbl-cap: Table example again
gt::gt(head(cars))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-iris
#| fig-cap: Figure example again
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width)
```

See @fig-example-iris and @tbl-example-cars
