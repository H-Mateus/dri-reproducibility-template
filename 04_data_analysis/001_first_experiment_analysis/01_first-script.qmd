# Read in data

Here is some prose.
Maybe you'd read in data and do some basic data wrangling here.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example
#| tbl-cap: Table example
gt::gt(head(iris))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: Figure example
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

See @fig-example and @tbl-example
