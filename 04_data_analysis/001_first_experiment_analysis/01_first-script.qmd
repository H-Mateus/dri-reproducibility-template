# Read in data

Here is some prose.
Maybe you'd read in data and do some basic data wrangling here.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: Figure example
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example2
#| tbl-cap: "A table made in another notebook"

data.frame(letters = letters[1:3], numbers = 1:3) |>
  knitr::kable()
```
