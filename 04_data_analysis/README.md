## Directory purpose

This is to house scripts for analysing data.
I'd suggest using literate programming approaches like [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) or [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for analysis so that good documentation and visualisations can easily be coupled to code.

The code library directory could house and shared code used across experiments like custom functions.

## *TODO*

- To include info on using `knitr::purl` to get code from Quarto docs.
- To add explanation of using `renv`.
